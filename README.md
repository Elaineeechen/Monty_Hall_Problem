# What is the Monty Hall Problem?
Imagine that you're at a gambling game. There are three doors in total, and each door corresponds to a prize behind. Two of the doors have a sheep behind them, and the other door has a sports car behind it. The emcee asks you to choose a door, then opens one of the two doors that you didn't choose, behind which is a sheep. Now, should you alter your choice?
